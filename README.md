**OnboardJS is an open-source ecosystem designed to help developers quickly and easily build highly customizable, dynamic, and effective user onboarding flows for modern web applications, with a strong focus on the React and Next.js ecosystems.**

The project consists of a powerful headless core engine, dedicated React bindings for seamless UI integration, and a future visual Builder application to streamline flow creation and management.

## The Vision üöÄ

User onboarding is one of the most critical parts of any application. A great onboarding experience can significantly improve user activation, feature adoption, and long-term retention. However, building flexible, context-aware, and engaging onboarding flows can be complex and time-consuming.

**OnboardJS aims to solve this by providing:**

*   **A Headless Core Engine:** A robust, framework-agnostic foundation for defining and managing onboarding logic.
*   **Seamless UI Integration:** First-class support for React & Next.js, allowing you to build any UI you can imagine.
*   **Maximum Customizability:** Control every aspect of your onboarding flow's appearance and behavior.
*   **Developer-Friendly Experience:** Built with TypeScript, well-tested, and thoroughly documented.
*   **A Vibrant Community:** A place to share best practices, plugins, templates, and get support.

Whether you want to code your entire onboarding experience from scratch with full control or eventually use a visual builder for speed, OnboardJS provides the tools you need.

## Packages in this Monorepo

This repository is a [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/) (or your chosen monorepo tool) monorepo containing the following key packages:

*   **`packages/core` (`@onboardjs/core`)**:
    *   The headless, framework-agnostic engine. It manages flow definitions, step transitions, conditional logic, data collection (`OnboardingContext`), persistence hooks, and lifecycle events.
    *   [‚û°Ô∏è Go to @onboardjs/core README](./packages/core/README.md)

*   **`packages/react` (`@onboardjs/react`)**:
    *   React bindings for the core engine. Provides an `OnboardingProvider` and the `useOnboarding` hook to easily integrate onboarding logic into your React and Next.js applications, allowing you to build fully custom UIs.
    *   [‚û°Ô∏è Go to @onboardjs/react README](./packages/react/README.md)

*   **`apps/docs` (Future - `docs.onboardjs.com`)**:
    *   The official documentation website for OnboardJS. (Placeholder for now)
    *   [‚û°Ô∏è Visit Documentation](#) (Link to be updated)

*   **`apps/storybook` (Development & Showcase)**:
    *   A Storybook instance for developing and showcasing React components from `@onboardjs/react` and example step components.
    *   Helps in visual testing and component documentation.

*   **`packages/eslint-config-custom` / `packages/tsconfig` (Internal)**:
    *   Shared ESLint and TypeScript configurations for consistent development across the monorepo.
