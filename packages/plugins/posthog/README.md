The official PostHog analytics plugin for **OnboardJS**.

This plugin automatically captures detailed events throughout your user onboarding flows, enabling you to understand user behavior, detect churn, analyze funnels, and optimize your flows with data-driven experiments‚Äîall with minimal setup.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **üöÄ Automatic Event Tracking**: Captures all critical onboarding events out-of-the-box, including flow starts, step views, completions, and errors.
*   **üìä Funnel & Churn Detection**: Automatically tracks step abandonment and calculates churn risk, helping you identify exactly where users drop off.
*   **üß™ A/B Testing Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with PostHog Feature Flags and Experiments to help you test and optimize different onboarding flows.
*   **‚ö° Performance Monitoring**: Captures step render times and other performance metrics to identify and fix slow or janky steps.
*   **üõ°Ô∏è Privacy-First**: Includes options to automatically redact PII and exclude sensitive data from your analytics events.
*   **üîß Deeply Customizable**: Tailor event names, enrich events with custom properties, and configure advanced features to match your exact needs.
*   **üìà Shareable Dashboards**: Comes with pre-built JSON templates for PostHog dashboards to get you started with analysis instantly.

## üì¶ Installation

Install the plugin and its peer dependencies using your favorite package manager:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @onboardjs/core @onboardjs/plugin-posthog posthog-js

# Using yarn
yarn add @onboardjs/core @onboardjs/plugin-posthog posthog-js

# Using pnpm
pnpm add @onboardjs/core @onboardjs/plugin-posthog posthog-js
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

Get up and running with just a few lines of code. This example assumes you are in a client-side environment like a React component.

```tsx
"use client";

import { OnboardingEngine } from "@onboardjs/core";
import { PostHogPlugin } from "@onboardjs/plugin-posthog";
import posthog from "posthog-js";

// 1. Initialize PostHog (do this once in your app)
posthog.init("YOUR_POSTHOG_API_KEY", {
  api_host: "https://app.posthog.com",
});

// 2. Create an instance of the plugin
const postHogPlugin = new PostHogPlugin({
  // Pass your initialized PostHog instance
  posthogInstance: posthog,
  // Enable debug logging in development
  debug: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development",
});

// 3. Add the plugin to your OnboardJS engine
const engine = new OnboardingEngine({
  steps: [
    // ... your onboarding steps
  ],
  plugins: [postHogPlugin],
});

// 4. Identify your user in PostHog
// This links all captured events to a specific user.
const user = engine.getState().context.currentUser;
if (user?.id) {
  posthog.identify(user.id, {
    email: user.email,
    name: user.name,
  });
}
```

That's it! The plugin will now automatically track user progress through your onboarding flow.

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

Customize the plugin to fit your production needs, including custom event names, data enrichment, and privacy controls.

```tsx
import { PostHogPlugin, PostHogPluginConfig } from "@onboardjs/plugin-posthog";

const advancedConfig: PostHogPluginConfig = {
  posthogInstance: posthog,
  eventPrefix: "saas_signup_", // e.g., saas_signup_step_active

  // Customize event names
  customEventNames: {
    flowCompleted: "user_onboarding_completed",
  },

  // Enrich events with custom data
  globalProperties: {
    onboarding_version: "2.1",
  },
  stepPropertyEnrichers: {
    // Add custom properties ONLY for steps of type 'ACCOUNT_SETUP'
    ACCOUNT_SETUP: (step, context) => ({
      account_type: context.flowData.accountType,
      team_size: context.flowData.teamSize,
    }),
  },

  // Privacy & Compliance
  excludePersonalData: true, // Automatically redacts common PII
  excludeFlowDataKeys: ["apiKey", "secretToken"], // Manually exclude sensitive keys

  // Advanced Features
  enableChurnDetection: true,
  churnTimeoutMs: 180000, // 3 minutes
  enableProgressMilestones: true,
  enableExperimentTracking: true,
  experimentFlags: ["new-welcome-copy", "show-video-tutorial"],
};

const advancedPlugin = new PostHogPlugin(advancedConfig);

// Use it in your engine
const engine = new OnboardingEngine({
  steps: [
    /* ... */
  ],
  plugins: [advancedPlugin],
});
```

## üìà Automatic Events

The plugin automatically captures the following events. You can use these to build funnels and insights in PostHog.

| Event Name (Default)      | Trigger                                                              | Key Properties                                                              |

| `onboarding_step_completed` | The user successfully completes a step and moves to the next.        | `step_id`, `completion_time_ms`, `render_time_ms`                           |
| `onboarding_step_abandoned` | The user is idle on a step for longer than `churnTimeoutMs`.         | `step_id`, `churn_risk_score`, `time_on_step_ms`                            |
| `onboarding_flow_completed` | The user successfully completes the final step of the flow.          | `total_steps`, `completion_time_ms`, `steps_skipped`                        |

| `onboarding_experiment_exposed` | A user is exposed to a variant of a configured feature flag.     | `experiment_flag`, `variant`                                                |

## üìä Shareable PostHog Dashboards

To get you started with analysis immediately, we've included pre-built dashboard templates.

1.  Go to your PostHog project's **Dashboards** page.
2.  Click the **"New dashboard"** button and select **"Import dashboard"** from the dropdown.
3.  Copy the JSON content from one of the files in the [`dashboards/`](https://github.com/Soma-ch/onboardjs/tree/main/packages/plugin-posthog/dashboards) directory of this plugin.
4.  Paste the JSON into the import modal and click **"Import"**.

**Available Dashboards:**

*   **Onboarding Funnel Analysis:** A top-level view of your entire onboarding funnel, from start to completion, with step-by-step drop-off rates.
*   **Churn & Abandonment Analysis:** Deep dive into where and why users are abandoning your flow.
*   **Experiment Performance:** Compare the performance of different onboarding variants when running A/B tests.
